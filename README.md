## Introduction

The Campus Navigation Project is designed to help students and visitors navigate a campus efficiently. The system utilizes graph data structures to represent the campus layout and implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between locations.

## Features

- **Graph Representation:** Models the campus using graph data structures.
- **Shortest Path Calculation:** Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to find the shortest path between two points.
- **Redis Integration:** Uses Redis for caching and fast data retrieval.
- **RESTful API:** Provides a RESTful API to interact with the navigation system.

## Technology Stack

- **Backend:** Go, Gin framework
- **Database:** Redis
- **Algorithm:** Dijkstra's algorithm for shortest path

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/ShawnJeffersonWang/CampusGuide.git
    cd CampusGuide
    ```

2. Ensure you have Go and Redis installed on your system.

3. Install the necessary Go dependencies:
    ```sh
    go mod tidy
    ```

4. Start Redis server if it is not already running:
    ```sh
    redis-server
    ```

5. Run the application:
    ```sh
    go run main.go
    ```

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can access the API endpoints to interact with the navigation system.

### Example Endpoints

- **Get Shortest Path:** `/api/shortest-path?start={start}&end={end}`
